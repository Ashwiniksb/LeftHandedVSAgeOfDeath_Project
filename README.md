# LeftHandedVSAgeOfDeath_Project
This is a project performed to re-check the old theory, which was believed to be true. In the project, we have used conditional probability and Bayes' Theorem to get to the result. If you are curious about a correlation between average age of death and left-handedness in people, you have come to the right place. " Correlation doesn't imply causation" is clearly proved here. 
I hope you enjoy. Happy learning and project-ing :)
